	<h1>Time and Space Complexity in Prgramming.</h1>
	<p>The Time Complexity of an algorithm/code is not equal to the actual time required to execute a particular code, but the number of times a statement executes.It gives how efficient a code is.</p>
	<p>Space Complexity is a measure of the amount of memory an algorithm needs to run. Using an array to store given data costs O(n).   <p>
