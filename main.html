   <h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is understood as the number of times a statement executes in code. As a programmer, your goal should to reduce the time complexity of the code by optimizzing it and make it more efficient. </p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b> is a related to the amount of memory occupied by the program. For Example, if a program takes an array of size n as input, the space complexity of the program becomes O(n).</p>
